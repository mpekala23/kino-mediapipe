# Building Locally

Before you can build your own local copy of the `mediasoup` python library for use in `src-python`, you must first install the dependencies. The original instructions from Google are [here](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/blob/master/docs/getting_started/install.md)

## Install Dependencies

```sh
brew install bazel bazelisk
```

```sh
xcode-select --install
```
